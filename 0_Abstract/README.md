# ABSTRACT
A wiper cleans raindrops or any other liquid off the vehicle's windscreen. The prior system required manual wiper activation,by changing the frequency As its results the operation of bringing up the wiper speed is varied . The project's goals are to improve ageing cars' systems by giving automated transmission wiping system, to improve the system by incorporating a sensor and actuator, and to create a simple software that would completely operate with the system.
